Territories Map Editor
==========================
A project for the Penn State Urban Gaming Club
---------------------------

### Who is this for? ###
Although made initially for the director of Territories at Penn State, anyone may use this code and change it as they wish.

### What is Territories? ###
Territories is a game that we play where we split the campus into separate territories distribute them, and then play 15 minute matches with nerf guns to determine who gets it. For more information check out the detailed rules on [our website](http://urbangaming.org/games/territories).
### How do I use this for my own map? ###
The map that the releases come with is the Penn State map, so unfortunately, you won't be able to just download the release. You'll need to fork the entire repo, though after that you only need to do two relatively straight forward tasks.  
1. Replace the base map file with your own map.  
2. Edit the Driver.java file in the Editor package.  
Yes you have to manually enter the coordinates (*for now*).

### What's the *Urban Gaming Club*? ###
One of the many clubs at the Pennsylvania State University. We offer plenty of games for students to play, our most known being Humans vs Zombies, but one of my favorites is Territories. Check out [our website](http://urbangaming.org/) for more information.
